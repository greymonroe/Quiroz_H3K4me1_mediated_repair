This repository contains code for analyses of 
1. MSH6 and PS5C, Tudor domain containing DNA repair proteins in plants.
2. Mutation experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and msh6 knockout lines.
3. Mutation datasets and chromatin states in fast neutron mutagenized rice.

We include code both for the published version of this paper as well as previous versions on biorXiv.

Data availability. 
Raw sequencing reads from wildtype and msh6 knockout lines are available on NCBI Bioproject PRJNA1039302. H3K4me1 and PDS5C ChIPseq data are available from Niu et al. (2021) at NCBI GEO Series accession number GSE154302. The crystal structure of A. thaliana PDS5C bound to H3K4me1 is available at RCSB PDB https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7DE9. Germline in A. thaliana mutations available from Weng et al. 2021, Monroe et al. 2022. Rice mutations are available at kitbase.ucdavis.edu. Rice ChIPseq data from Lu et al (2019) are available on NCBI GEO  accession number GSE128434. Rice polymorphism data are available at https://snp-seek.irri.org/. The rice reference genome can be accessed https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/. The Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10 genome can be accessed at Arabidopsis.org.
